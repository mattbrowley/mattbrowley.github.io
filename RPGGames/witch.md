Everything about the Witch: [Archives of Nethys](https://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx?ID=38){:target="_blank"}

You command powerful magic, not through study or devotion to any ideal, but as a vessel or agent for a mysterious, otherworldly patron that even you don't entirely understand. This entity might be a covert divinity, a powerful fey, a manifestation of natural energies, an ancient spirit, or any other mighty supernatural beingâ€”but its nature is likely as much a mystery to you as it is to anyone else. Through a special familiar, your patron grants you versatile spells and powerful hexes to use as you see fit, though you're never certain if these gifts will end up serving your patron's larger plan.

**During Combat Encounters...**

You cast spells to change the course of battle. You use magical hexes to hamper enemies and aid allies, while leveraging more powerful spells to control the battlefield, heal, or harm, aided by your extraordinary familiar, brewed potions, and magical items.

**During Social Encounters...**

You provide knowledge on numerous topics, including a variety of magical matters, and you might call upon your patron's magic to charm or deceive others.

**While Exploring...**

You remain alert for magical traps and treasures, employing a clever array of spells to overcome obstacles that stand in your way. Your familiar might aid you through its own considerable set of exceptional abilities.

**In Downtime...**

You brew potions, craft other magical items, or hunt for new spells for your familiar to learn. You might try to learn more about your patron, their aims, or your own powers, and you might seek out the company of other witches for collaboration or community.

**You Might...**

* Strive to learn more about your patron or familiar, your patron's goals, why they chose to empower you, and how you fit into their plans.
* Seek out new sources of magic, like scrolls and spellbooks, to supplement the spells your patron provides.
* View your familiar as a steadfast ally, a dear friend, or a necessary nuisance, depending on its personality.

**Others Probably...**

* Wonder about the nature of your patron and the source of your magic, worrying you'll turn on them or that you unknowingly serve to a foul power.
* Appreciate your ability to aid them with magic, whether you do so by helping them directly or by hampering their adversaries.
* Take care not to offend you, fearful that you'll place a malicious hex on them if you're angered.
